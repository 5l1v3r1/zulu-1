README for zulu generating controlled wireless traffic:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Get the zulu source and compile.

2. Get the drivers for the atheros card (madwifi-ng) and make sure you have the 
   linux wireless tools installed (iwconfig).

3. Set the card in Monitor mode for most people the below commands will place 
   the card in Monitor mode.

wlanconfig ath0 destroy
wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor
ifconfig ath0 up
   

4.  Tips for command line parameters:
-i : interface name (typically ath0)
-s : Src MAC address (example 000102030405) without the ':'
-d : Give in broadcast FFFFFFFFFFFF to avoid retries and ACK's
--file : File name which contains the number of data,mgmt and ctrl frames. An
example of the file is as follows:

DATA 10
MGMT 20
CTRL 30

This would generate 10 data frames, 20 MGMT frames and 30 control
frames.

There is no input checking on this file input. So PV guys please take
it easy and give in the same order :)

5. The script trafficgen.sh is the script which invokes zulu with the
   parameters specified in the file. It is a trivial script and one
   can also invoke it manually. The script takes in 3 parameters:
   SRC_MAC and DEST_MAC and ESSID of the AP. 

NOTE: This script is out of date and may no longer work. It will be 
removed or updated in a future version.

NOTE: This utility would only work in monitor mode as the card needs
to remain fixed on a channel. Thus there could be some more traffic on
the channel. You need to take this into account which verifying the
pie charts. The essid used is "zulu" for the beacon frames. This
way you can verify the number of beacons transmitted on this essid.

If there is a sniffer available which is sniffing the wireless medium,
then to verify the traffic generated you can use the gollowing grep
commands:
grep zulu d3 | wc -l // For Mgmt Frames
